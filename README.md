# Mesmer

A small overly complicated script for running common
[meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) commands. The utility it provides
is very limited. The same could have been accomplised with bash aliases. But
I still went ahead and wrote it. Because why not?

It is named after Franz Mesmer because meson ~~--> mesmer. Gettit?

All the arguments are kept short. Nothing longer than 2 characters, including
the script name itself.
